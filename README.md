# Ski-SYS
I implemented a skiing system where users can login as a teacher(mrwalsh5:password5). 
Then proceeds to main menu where the user has the option to add new student details which will be stored in a txt file.
or look at groups where the users are sorted based on age,ability, gender etc..
System has been created in python.
